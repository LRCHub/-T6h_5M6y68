Down to my bones know I'm a fighter
And there ain't no point avoiding it
I'll beat my father for my mother
Blood is boiling out
My opponents feel like nothing
They're destroyed
Baki Hanma come to play so where to toys at?
I don't care if I'm the strongest
Who run the bag?
I only want one thing
To defeat my dad
Yujiro Hanma I promise you your death
Emi Akezawa I'll have my revenge

Everybody talking 'bout my pops
Well I don't give a fuck
Im the kind of guy you disrespect
And end up in the trunk
Im the kind of guy they talk about
I show they shriveled up
Drive by except I'm shooting all the ones thats driven up
Bitch I'm all up in that ass
That's offensive in your butt
I've been on the Neosporin tibit
Mobbin in the cut
Number one's the only option
Like the count I've risen up
And left them floating in the water
What we call them sitting ducks

To be the best you gotta beat the best
So if you want to ship a lethal test
Well this can be addressed
I call my fists the operators
Dial it up and we connect
Got optic fiber flow I do a gig
And make the beat arrest

I just want to be the top of the league
Diesel fit it must be dominant genes
Wolf inside up built to body the sheep
So if you want to live then follow my lead
O.P. so the op it is me
And the op's well they opposite me
And they dope fiends I ain't talking 'bout weed
When I roll up leave 'em chronic fatigued

I don't need a gun fists are classified as nuclear
Those who claim immovable
I take them and their moved to tears
Those who claim immovable
I take them and I moved them tears
And when I'm through with losers
Give their asses back as souvenirs

Bones know I'm a fighter
And there ain't no point avoiding it

Bitch don't get it twisted busted by a distance
You and me are different you aint got to listen
Listen to the hits and they never dippin'
Everytime I slip they keep it to the trenches
Every shot I take it kill with just a snippet
Poppin off that lip but maybe you should zip it
I can't never quit Im living with a sickness
Iller then the rest so haters they just nitpick
Listen to the flow and listen to the lyrics
Listen to the cadence, listen to the rhythm
Listen to the words and listen to the vision
Ragdoll the bitches livin' with different visions
Bitch I'm ridiculous
Get a hold of your tongue or it's lickety-split
You wanna get turned up well lets turn up
It ain't shit but a flick of the switch bitch

I can go on a bit all this barking's ironic
I didn't squawk to my father
We just would brawl didn't bother
With all the talking and fodder
Your wondering why I brought it up
Easy you are my sons
And I ain't talking a homonym
Come and fight me
I've seen the world
And ain't nobody like me
Surgical since day one
You're operating on a type beat
Hamna a motherfucker you can peep it on the I.D.
You'll get laced uppercut
Will have you flying out your Nikes

Down to my bones know I'm a fighter
And there ain't no point avoiding it
I'll beat my father for my mother
Blood is boiling out
My opponents feel like nothing
They're destroyed
Baki Hanma come to play so where to toys at?
I don't care if I'm the strongest
Who run the bag?
I only want one thing
To defeat my dad
Yujiro Hanma I promise you your death
Emi Akezawa I'll have my revenge

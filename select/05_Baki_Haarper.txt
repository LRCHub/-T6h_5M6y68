She don't need no reason i'ma do what I do
Make this money
Beat her pussy up until it's black n blue
It is funny all you fuckers wanna know
How I be movin in the shadows
Hidden even with da glow
She don't need no reason i'ma do what I do
Make this money
Beat her pussy up until it's black n blue
It is funny all you fuckers wanna know
How I be movin in the shadows
Hidden even with da glow
Right swing left swing
Make a muthafucka sing left wing with a ding
Yo plane gon bring itself to rubble
The tall gon crash you a mental giant
No scribe of the past
Get high with the hash i'ma fly with a dash
You try with a lap get a knife in a back
She chewin, she chewin
On my dick like bubble gum
Lungin with the broom stick grip
I pop off you a knock off
Get a redbone she be top notch
With the lock jaw
Jello when I pound the mound
Pussy good in my mouth
Only for the honor roll
Then I let her go south i be calm I'm free
I let it all go when I'm in the battle
With the steel I mow steal high low
Trophy skull yautja boutta go off
In the dojo
Let a pedestrian go see what it means to be
Numbah 1 in the street
Bringing fear to ya eye like Spec you gon
Die Hanayama with the longevity and knee
I be baki no shotty pilin up all the bodies
Found a girl she a taki in the lobby she bad
Break her body she be naughty
All up on me name Bonnie
Slurp that pussy like dasani
Make her boyfriend mad huh
I be gettin all the honeys on me like yuh
Makin all this money while you only gettin
Crumbs livin lavish where it's sunny you my
Son call me amen ra raw doggin
Ya mom
She don't need no reason i'ma do what I do
Make this money
Beat her pussy up until it's black n blue
It is funny all you fuckers wanna know
How I be movin in the shadows
Hidden even with da glow
